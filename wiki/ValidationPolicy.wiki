#summary How the Office-o-tron validates your documents

= General =

The Office-o-tron validates ODF or OOXML documents using two validation layers:

 * schema validation
 * programmatic application of normative constraints specified in the standards.


= ODF Schemas =

The appropriate ODF schema is selected using the version attribute on root elements of XML documents.

The ODF schemas (certainly prior to version 1.2) exhibit a common construction error that occurs when RELAX NG schemas use ID/IDREF types. This is disregarded for the purposes of validation.
